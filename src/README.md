# Three Tier App

This directory contains copy of the 'official' JSS Three Tier Web App
source code:

* [middleware](./middleware/)
* [frontend](./frontend/)

Per the original author [tpryan](http://who/tpryan), these were created from
the Deploystack [three-tier-app][1] as private repositories for [middleware][2]
and [frontend][3] respectively. The official production JSS Docker images were
built and pushed from there.
